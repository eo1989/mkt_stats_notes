# Conditional probability utilizing Bayes theorem:
## Probability:
- A probability is a fraction of a finite set.
- ex: survey 1000 people, and 20 of them are bank tellers, the fraction shows that bank tellers are 2%, or 0.02 of the population. Chosing a random person out of this population would have a 2% chance of being a bank teller.

Using GSS (General Social Survey) data here use pandas to read the data and extract the columns we need.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

gss = pd.read_csv('ThinkBayes2')
```
