    "    Below we examine the case of an individual playing a game with the following rules: \n",
    "    - n iterations\n",
    "    - each iteration is a flip of a biased coin with p = 0.8\n",
    "    - in each iteration, an individual bets $1 on either H or T. They lose their bet if they are wrong, win their bet if they are right.\n",
    "    Obviously the dominant strategy is to bet $1 on H every time if p > 0.5, else bet 1 on T every time.\n",
    "    Probability matching\" is the observed bias in which people tend to bet H with a frequency approx equal to the probability of H, i.e betting heads 80% of the time.\n",
    "    Consider a situation where the coin has known bias p >= 0.5 and we bet heads with frequency f. Elementary arithmetic shows that the EV per iteration is 1 - 2(f+p-2fp).\n",
    "    In the \"optimal\" case f=1, we recover EV = 2p-1. Probability matching yields (2p-1)^2."
